This is a simple RPG character design of a Character named Arya.
It uses a power system named mana which is responsible for the execution of her skills. Each skill will use some mana which means mana is important to perform each and every skill.
Arya has 2 skils which includes one Heal skill which increases her health and a Projectile attack which destroys the enemy in three hits.
The skills cannot be used continously as there is a Cooldown system initialised which gives some time before the skill can be used again. The cooldown can be seen in the bottom hud also as the full image of the skill will attain its full brightness when the skill will be ready again to perform.
This character also has a fully fledged HUD initialised which shows the player image, the player health and the player's mana level.

The Images of HUD and full video walkthroughs are attached.
